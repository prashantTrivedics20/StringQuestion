    //Shefin gives you a string S and you have to find a non-empty string P such that:
    //
    //P is a substring of S.
    //No non-empty substring of P is a prefix of S.
    //No non-empty substring of P is a suffix of S.
    //For all such possible strings, find the length of the longest string satisfying all the conditions. If no such string is possible, print âˆ’1.
    //
    //A string A is a substring of a string B if A can be obtained from B by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end.
    //A prefix of a string A, is a substring of A that occurs at the beginning of A. For example, "code" is a prefix of "codechef", but "ode" is not.
    //A suffix of a string A, is a substring of A that occurs at the end of A. For example, "chef" is a suffix of "codechef", but "he" is not.
